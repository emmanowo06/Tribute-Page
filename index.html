      <h2>Who is Mary Okenwa?</h2>
        <h3>A Devoted Christian Sister</h3>
        <h3>An Examplary Mother</h3>
        <h3>A Godly Advisor in Dulwich Region, UK</h3>
        <h3>A Virtuous Wife of the Regional Overseer</h3>
          <p>It is hard to accept the magnitude of your physical loss to the brethren at Dulwich region and the Deeper Christian Life Ministry,UK but I took consolation from the Holy Spirit that you rested in the Lord.</p>
          <p>Your service to the church and the body of Christ speak volumes and will keep testifying gloriously for eternity.</p> 
          <p>Our late pastor, your husband, trusted in your arrangement to feed the church in any service you were needed so.</p>
          <p>You are a truly virtous woman, decorated with grace,wisdom, understanding and hardwork as the mother of the region.</p>
         <p>You raised good children who are able to race with the spiritual 'mantle' left behind by you and your husband.</p>
          <p>You truly ran the good race and finished your course gloriously. Sleep on in the bossom of Our Creator until that glorious resurrection morning when we meet to part no more.</p>
